    <p class="bold">Donate through crowdfunding<p>
    In May of this year a group of incredible people cycled the 2000 miles from London to Athens to raise money for Khora. To carry on their support, they are making preparations for cycle number three in Autumn 2018. Follow the link below if you would like to make a donation. The easiest way to do this is through their fundraising page. All funds through the page will go directly to Khora. Visit the website for more details and how you can get involved - www.thighsofsteel.com
