    <p>
      Khora is moving! The last day that our current building will be open is Friday the 1st of June. We will move into a new building soon and carry on providing a range of services.
      <br/><br/>
      Opening and running Khora has been a massive learning process. We have made mistakes on the way, working with bureaucracy that (for most of us) is in a foreign language. It is now necessary for us to move to comply with urban planning regulations.
<br/><br/>
      Khora has be functioning in this building for over a year and a half. Weâ€™ve managed to transform an industrial building into a diverse community centre which has welcomed thousands of people stuck in Athens through our doors along side a multitude of grassroots organisations and independent projects. In our current building we are no longer able to do this.
<br/><br/>
      We are part of a community that is constantly changing, as such it is important to us that our organisational structure is open to change. This move is an opportunity for us to transform our activities and organization to better reflect the current situation and needs in Athens and in our community.
<br/><br/>
      The work wont be ending here! Many of our activities will continue externally until our new building opens. We are still in need of ongoing support both financially and with new volunteers. We are especially in need of people who have skills that can be helpful when moving, for example architects, builders, painters, plumbers, electricians, etc. To our wider support base, we are still a functioning community and welcome your support and solidarity.
<br/><br/>
      Thank you to everyone who has made Khora at Asklipiou 80 what it is. We invite you to join us as we continue our journey. We will keep you updated with this process along the way.
<br/><br/>
      Big love. Big respect.
